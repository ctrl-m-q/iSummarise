# iSummarise
iSummarise is a web application that summarises texts parsed into the input field using ChatGPT's DaVinci model through the API.
It regurgitates a comprehensive summary of what was being parsed. Also, if links are parsed through the input field, it goes to the website, copies the texts, sends it to the model through the API and delivers your summarised text. It isn't hosted yet. I need to add a few more functionalities before i host it.
